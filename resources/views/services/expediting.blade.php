                    <p class="lead appear-animation text-dark text-justify" data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="700">In the past, Expediting has been considered a corrective function rather than a preventive function. However, as both the schedule and the pricing of projects continue to become increasingly critical.</p>
