ENIECO Environment Consultants aim to predict environmental impacts at an early stage in project planning and design, find ways and means to reduce adverse impacts, shape projects to suit the local environment and present the predictions and options to decision-makers.</p>
                    <p class="lead appear-animation text-dark text-justify" data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="700">EIA is anticipatory, participatory and systematic in nature and relies on multidisciplinary input. It is a means to assessing the present state of health of ecosystem where project would be executed and to work out the possible impact it could bring in course of the time. By using EIA both environmental and economic benefits can be achieved, such as reduced cost and time of project implementation and design, avoided treatment/clean-up costs and impacts of laws and regulations.</p>
                    <p class="lead appear-animation animated fadeInUpShorter appear-animation-visible text-justify text-dark" data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="700" style="animation-delay: 700ms;">The objective of EIA is to foresee the potential environmental problems that would arise out of a proposed development and address them in the project's planning and design stage. The EIA process should then allow for the communication of this information to: (a) The project proponent (b) The regulatory agencies and (c) All stakeholders and interest groups.</P>
