It is a means to assessing the present state of health of ecosystem where project would be executed and to work out the possible impact it could bring in course of the time. By using EIA both environmental and economic benefits can be achieved, such as reduced cost and time of project implementation and design, avoided treatment/clean-up costs and impacts of laws and regulations.</P>

The EIA process should then allow for the communication of this information to: (a) The project proponent (b) The regulatory agencies and (c) All stakeholders and interest groups.</P>
